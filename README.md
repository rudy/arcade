# Rudy's Arcade -- Experimental

A collection of experimental [Rudy](http://github.com/solutious/rudy) routine configurations. 

*NOTE: These examples are a work in progress*

## Contributions

We except contributions! Rudy supports all Linux-based platforms (with partial Solaris support) and software (rails, sinatra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc...) so it's possible to write routines for pretty much anything. Anything you can do in a script you can do with Rudy. Fork the repo and send a pull request or send a link a gist and we'll include it here with credit.
